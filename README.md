The following repository is for working through Reuven Lerner's Weekly Python Exercises.<br>
This is his most advanced (B3) track: https://store.lerner.co.il/wpe <br>
I've been a long time follower of Reuven and have learned a TON from him over the years. I'm definitely looking forward to these challenges.<br>
With these exercises I'm also trying to move closer to a IDE workflow versus running everything in Jupyter Notebooks. <br>
Onwward. Upward. <br>
